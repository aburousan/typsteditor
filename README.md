# Typst Editor — Tauri port

A Tauri-based build of [Typst Editor](https://github.com/aburousan/typsteditor).
Same UI, same features, same behaviour — but the Electron shell + Node/Express
backend are replaced by **one small Rust binary**, so the app is dramatically
smaller and lighter.

| | Electron build | Tauri build |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS `.dmg` | 97–104 MB | **7.2 MB** |
| Unpacked app | 248–255 MB | **18 MB** |
| Runtime processes | Electron + Node utility process | one native process |
| Memory | Chromium + Node | system WebView (WKWebView) |

## How it works

The original app is a React UI that talks to a local HTTP backend
(`server.js`, Express) on `127.0.0.1`. This port keeps that contract intact:

- **`src-tauri/src/server.rs`** — a 1:1 Rust (axum) reimplementation of every
  `server.js` endpoint: workspace file tree / read / write / upload / delete,
  Typst compile (PDF/HTML/PNG), templates, Typst Universe package search /
  install / remove, git (init/commit/push/log), code execution
  (Python / Julia / Wolfram with the same interpreter auto-detection, sandbox,
  denylist screening, equation-mode wrapping and image detection), DOI/arXiv
  BibTeX lookup, WebDAV sync, local-folder sync, export — plus serving the
  built UI on the same origin.
- **`src-tauri/src/main.rs`** — the shell (mirrors `electron/main.cjs`):
  free-port pick (3001 preferred), PATH augmentation for GUI launches,
  bundled Typst-package seeding into a writable cache
  (`TYPST_PACKAGE_CACHE_PATH`), workspace at `~/Documents/TypstEditor`,
  a native window pointing at the local server, external links opened in the
  real browser, and a `window.desktop.pickFolder()` bridge (native folder
  dialog) injected so **File → Open Folder** works exactly as in Electron.
- **`src-tauri/resources/dist`** — the *unmodified* production build of the
  original frontend (copied from `../typst-editor/dist`). Zero frontend
  changes were needed.
- **`src-tauri/resources/typst-packages`** — the same bundled packages
  (cetz, physica, fletcher, …) as the Electron app.

Like the original: the **Typst CLI** must be on your PATH, and
Python/Julia/Wolfram are optional (only for the code-execution features).
`ALLOW_CODE_EXECUTION=0` and `EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS` are honoured.

## Build

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo build                        # debug binary
npx @tauri-apps/cli@latest build   # release .app (+ dmg)
```

If the Tauri dmg step fails (Finder scripting), make it manually:

```bash
cd target/release/bundle
mkdir dmg-staging && cp -R "macos/Typst Editor.app" dmg-staging/ && ln -s /Applications dmg-staging/Applications
hdiutil create -volname "Typst Editor" -srcfolder dmg-staging -ov -format UDZO "dmg/Typst Editor.dmg"
```

### Refreshing the UI from the original project

The frontend is consumed as a build artifact — to pick up UI changes:

```bash
cd ../typst-editor && npm run build
rm -rf ../typst-editor-tauri/src-tauri/resources/dist
cp -R dist ../typst-editor-tauri/src-tauri/resources/dist
```

## Linux and Windows builds

Tauri compiles native code against each OS's system webview (WebKitGTK on
Linux, WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS), so — unlike Electron — it
**cannot cross-compile**. Each platform is built on (or in a container of) that
OS. Two supported paths:

### Linux — locally, in a container (used to produce the shipped `.deb`/AppImage)

```bash
docker build -t typst-editor-linux-builder -f linux-build/Dockerfile linux-build/
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work typst-editor-linux-builder
# → src-tauri/target-linux/release/bundle/{appimage,deb}/…
```

On an Apple-Silicon Mac this builds native **arm64** Linux bundles; on an x86_64
host (e.g. the build server) it builds native **amd64** bundles. To force the
other arch add `--platform linux/amd64` (or `linux/arm64`) to both commands —
that runs under emulation and is slower.

### Windows

Building Windows **must** happen on a real Windows toolchain (MSVC + WebView2).
A `cargo-xwin` cross-build from Linux exists (`linux-build/Dockerfile.win`) and
produces an NSIS installer, but it is **experimental and unreliable** — the
resulting app frequently fails to launch on real Windows (resource / WebView2
embedding differs from a native MSVC build). Confirmed broken in testing, so do
**not** ship the cross-built `.exe`. Use CI instead:

### GitHub Actions — the supported route (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)

Pushing the `tauri-port` branch (or a `v*` tag, or a manual run) builds on
**native** runners — Linux (AppImage + `.deb` + `.rpm`), Windows (NSIS `.exe` +
`.msi`) and macOS (`.dmg`) — and uploads each as an artifact. This is the only
reliable way to get a working Windows build without a Windows machine.

## Headless / server-only mode

For testing (or Docker-style use) the same binary can run the backend alone,
like `node server.js` did:

```bash
./target/release/typst-editor --headless        # PORT, TYPST_WORKSPACE, TYPST_DIST respected
```

## Security model

Same posture as the original (local, single-user), with extra hardening added
in the Rust backend:

- Binds to `127.0.0.1` only.
- **Host-header check** — requests whose `Host` isn't `127.0.0.1`/`localhost`
  are rejected (blocks DNS-rebinding, where a hostile domain resolves to
  loopback to reach this server from a victim's browser).
- **Origin check** — any request carrying a non-local `Origin` is rejected
  (blocks drive-by websites POSTing to the local port; browsers attach `Origin`
  to cross-site requests, including the "simple" ones that skip CORS preflight).
- Workspace file access is confined to the workspace dir (path-traversal
  rejected, lexically — same guard as the original).
- Code execution is opt-outable (`ALLOW_CODE_EXECUTION=0`), time-limited
  (`EXEC_TIMEOUT_MS`), runs in `workspace/sandbox/`, and is screened for
  process/network/shell/destructive calls. As in the original, this is a
  heuristic guardrail, **not** a hardened sandbox — don't run untrusted
  documents.

## Performance notes

- Release profile: `lto = true`, `codegen-units = 1`, `opt-level = "s"`,
  `strip = true`, `panic = "abort"` — smaller, faster binary.
- Hashed `assets/` (Monaco is ~3.6 MB) are served `immutable, max-age=1y` so the
  webview caches them across launches; `index.html` is `no-cache` so UI updates
  still land.
- One native process using the OS webview instead of Electron + a bundled
  Chromium + a Node backend process — much lower memory and faster cold start.

## Notes

- The Tauri app is ad-hoc signed automatically; the same first-launch
  Gatekeeper note as the Electron build applies.
- If the macOS dmg step fails with a Finder-automation error, approve the
  "control Finder" permission prompt, or build it manually with `hdiutil` (see
  the Build section).
